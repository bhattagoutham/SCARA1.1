# SCARA1.1
This project implements a scara robot. Also a cool thing is that you could make the robot draw an image.
You need to have OpenCV-Python binding to execute these programs. Once you have all the prerequisite 
libraries installed, Just run the im_pts.py and wait for the result. Ensure that you place the images in 
the same directory as that of the remaining programs, also check if their names are correctly mentioned in
the program. Once everything is set you must see an output simialar to that of given in test images folder.
